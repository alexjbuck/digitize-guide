# Getting Started on Digitize

This references and should not supercede the [Digitize Tutorial](https://confluence.il2.dso.mil/display/puckboardhelp/Common+API%3A+How+to+use+your+Scratch+Space+in+a+Digitize+Application) guide. I tried to write this in a way that should be a bit more accessible to beginners.

Also reference the official Digitize Docs [here](https://digitize.apps.dso.mil/sites/docs/).

> If at any point you get stuck, you can email help@dsop.io to get help.

> A common error while getting started is finding that you do not have the permission to access a site, e.g. code.il2.dso.mil or jira.il2.dso.mil etc... You should contact help@dsop.io to get a ticket created for you in support of your Digitize project.
