# Step 1: Request a new Digitize project

Now that you're in the Tron channel, click on the `+` button in the left navigation bar (next to the team name, Tron) to open the channel list. Find the `Digitize - Public` team and join it. This is the place to ask questions and get help related to Digitize, CI/CD, and deployment of your project.

In the channel header there will be a link to `Request a new Digitize Repository`. At time of writing, the link is a google form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSemenfdx9U6ftW3UfYKUySO4e0S1MMoqKgmI4WRw543PzIg4w/viewform).

If you do not hear a response within a working day or two, you can post in the `Digitize - Public` channel and ask for help.
